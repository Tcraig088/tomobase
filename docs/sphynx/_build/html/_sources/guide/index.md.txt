It allows the reconstruction of 3D volume data using the ASTRA Toolbox. The library is designed to allow users to perform allignments, reconstructions, and post processing steps withing a Juypter Notebook. Additionally, tomobase is designed as base library with registration systems to allow for extended functionalities to be built on top of.

## Installation

To install, install [PyQt5](https://google.co.nz) or [PySide2](https://google.co.nz) to use graphical interfaces for file saving and loading. Optionally, all functions within Tomo Base can be accelerated using the [cuda toolkit](https://google.co.nz) and [CUPY](https://google.co.nz). These do not have to be installed though. However, if desired install these libraries before usage.

```bash
conda install pyqt cuda-toolkit=XX.X cupy -c conda-forge
pip install .
